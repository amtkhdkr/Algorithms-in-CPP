A collection of interesting programming problems and their solutions in C++

This is merely a collection of problems that I particularly loved solving successfully. Most of these problems are obtained from the Internet, freely availiable to any one via a simple web search.

This is mostly a private collection but readers are encouraged to share and improve any of the codes they can with more effective and effecient solutions. Please note that these solutions are merely a first instinct and they might not be up to the mark in terms of space and time complexity blah blah.

You are free to refer to the solutions given here for your own use wherever you'd like. Citation of this code is not necessary but would be welcome!
